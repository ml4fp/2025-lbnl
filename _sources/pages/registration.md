## Participation Modes

Participants can join the program in-person or remotely (via zoom). While we support the remote participants to our best ability, you will be able to make most out of this program by in-person participantion. We strongly reccomend you to come to Berekeley.

**You can choose one of the three participation modes for registration:**
- In-person
- Remote (with GPU reservation)
- Remote (without GPU reservation)

The total number of registrations for each participation mode will be capped, so please register as soon as possible!

:class: note
- `In-person` and `Remote (without GPU reservation)` participants will be guranteed to have GPU access during the school.
- Participants with `Remote (without GPU reservation)` registration will be given GPU access if avilable.
  - We will try our best to provide GPU access to all the remote participants.
