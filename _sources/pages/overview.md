# Overview

We will introduce fundamental concepts of machine learning accompanied by hands-on tutorials of the essential open-source ML packages. The program will cover particle physics specific use cases and deployment of the trained models in C++ software (eg. Athena) / FPGAs, with lots of hands-on examples. There will be invited talks from veteran ML experts in HEP who have previously deployed ML for different tasks in experiments.

Attendees can expect to gain an overview of the range of current and upcoming ML applications in HEP, and also learn some of the particle physics specific tricks that an ML practitioner picks up from experience. We will try to address the typical ML questions that often come up in analysis meetings.

Tentative topics to be covered (many will include a hands-on component):

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Introduction to standard open-source ML packages like Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Keras and Pytorch
- Overview of ML in particle physics
- Practitioners guide to handling particle physics datasets
- Generative Models
- Neural Simulation-Based Inference
- Uncertainty treatment
- Unfolding
- Exploiting symmetries in physics data
- Graph Neural Networks in particle physics 
- Transformers and LLMs
- Differentiable Programming
- Deploying NNs in C++ and python: ONNXRuntime 
- Deploying NNs on FPGA: Quantization, Model prunnning and compression, hls4ml
