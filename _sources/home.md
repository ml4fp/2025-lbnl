<h3> 4-8 August, 2025 <br/> Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</h3>

The Machine Learning for Fundamental Physics (ML4FP) School will be hosted at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
All talks and tutorials will be given in person, and participants can register to participate in-person or virtually. 
After two highly successful US ATLAS Machine Learning (ML) training events in 2022 and 2023, followed by a successful ML4FP event in 2024, 
we are excited to continue this pattern. This event remains open to all particle physicists.
this year the program is open to all of particle physics.

NERSC will provide training accounts with GPU nodes for registered participants. 
Thanks to the financial assistance provided by US ATLAS through the ATC program. US ATLAS students will be eligible for financial assistance with housing during their stay. 
There will also be a dedicated parallel session for ATLAS, CMS and DUNE specific ML skills.
