# Intro to ML

We'll have two tutorial sessions on the first day:

1. Morning: Introduction to PyTorch and binary classification
2. Afternoon: Binary classification on a HEP data set

The morning session will cover the basic under-pinnings of ML, the afternoon session will focus on practical advice for training NNs on HEP data sets.
